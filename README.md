# XRM

**XRM** is an open-source, AI-assisted agency management system designed for small agencies, freelancers, and service-based teams.

It brings together CRM, project management, team management, accounting, invoices, notifications, role-based access control, and RTL-first user experience into one integrated dashboard.

> The project is in an early public stage and is actively being improved.

## Why XRM?

Small agencies often manage their work across many disconnected tools: spreadsheets, task managers, chat apps, invoice tools, and manual client tracking.

XRM is an attempt to bring these workflows into one focused, customizable, and open-source system.

The goal is to help teams manage:

- Clients and connections
- Projects and deadlines
- Team members and permissions
- Invoices and accounting
- Internal notes and notifications
- Role-based access for admins, team members, and clients
- RTL-first dashboards for Persian and other right-to-left teams
